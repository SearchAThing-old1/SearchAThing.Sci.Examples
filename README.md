Examples for SearchAThing.Sci

- [Example01](/src/Example01/Program.cs) : create a sci project with two measure object inside it and serialize then read back from deserialized data. Here measure serialized contains value and measure unit. Use this type of solution if want to keep track of the measure unit ( eg. user interface )
- [Example02](/src/Example02/Program.cs) : create a sci project with two measure object as double thus using a measure unit domain. Use this type of solution if want minimize file size ( eg. many data )
- [Example03](/src/Example03/Program.cs) : create a mesh2d given some input points
